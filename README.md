# Document_Scanner
The code captures an image from a file, resizes it, converts it to grayscale, applies smoothing and edge detection, identifies contours, and extracts the four corners of a document in the image. Finally, it performs a perspective transformation to obtain a "bird's eye view" of the document and displays the result using OpenCV.
